          explicitly agreed otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redistribution, resale, or commercial use requires separate licensing
          and may incur additional fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients may not claim the avatar as their own creation. Proper credit

        <li>
          <strong
            >Clients may not modify or resell the avatar for profit without

          >
        </li>
        <li>

          additional charges.

        <li>
          Major deviations from initial scope will be treated as separate
          commissions.
