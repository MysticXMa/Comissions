      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By placing an order through Mystic's VRChat Avatar Commissions, you
        agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service. This
        agreement serves as a legally binding contract between you (the client)
        and the service provider. Please read all terms carefully before
        proceeding with any purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you disagree with any part of these terms, you must refrain from
        placing an order.
        <strong
          >Continuing to use this service implies full acceptance of these
          conditions.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h2>2. Payment Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Full payment is required upfront</strong> via the approved
          payment methods: Cash App, Donation Alerts, or PayPal. This policy
          ensures both parties' commitment to the project.
        </li>
        <li>
          Payment confirmations will be sent to the client once received.
          <strong
            >Delayed payments may result in rescheduling or cancellation of your
            order.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Currency conversions and associated fees are the client’s
          responsibility. Ensure the full payment amount reflects in the service
          provider’s account after any transaction fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          For payments made in installments, the final installment must be paid
          before the final product is delivered.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Refunds are only available under the following circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the creator is unable to complete the work due to personal or
              technical reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the final product deviates significantly from the agreed-upon
              specifications, at the creator’s discretion.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If the customer is dissatisfied with the final product, they may
          request a full remake at no additional cost, provided the base model
          remains the same.
          <strong
            >Choosing a different base model will require additional
            charges.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Refunds are
          <strong
            >not available for changes in personal circumstances,
            dissatisfaction with minor details after a remake, or delays caused
            by the client.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >In case of disputes regarding the refund, both parties may reach
            out to a third-party mediator to resolve the issue.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Delivery Timeline</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Estimated delivery times vary depending on the selected package and
          the complexity of the project. Starter Pack projects typically require
          1–2 days, Premium Pack projects require 2–4 days, and Ultimate Pack
          projects may take 5+ days or longer for intricate designs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients will be informed promptly of any delays caused by unforeseen
          circumstances, such as technical difficulties or personal emergencies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Delivery timelines are approximate and subject to revisions. Final
          deadlines may shift based on collaboration and the time taken to
          review proofs or drafts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >If delivery exceeds 14 days from the originally agreed-upon date,
            the client is eligible for a partial refund depending on the project
            stage.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Usage Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Commissioned avatars are intended for personal use only unless
          explicitly agreed otherwise in a separate written agreement. This
          includes VRChat or other compatible platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redistribution, resale, or commercial use of the commissioned work is
          prohibited without prior authorization. Violations of this term may
          result in legal action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients may not claim commissioned work as their own creation. Proper
          credit must be attributed to Me (Mystic) where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Clients may not modify the avatar or asset for resale without
            permission.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Modifications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All packages include a limited number of minor revisions to ensure
          client satisfaction. Excessive revisions or significant alterations
          may incur additional charges, depending on the scope of the changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Revision requests must be submitted within 7 days of receiving the
          final product.
          <strong
            >Requests made after this period will not be honored without
            additional compensation.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Any requests that substantially deviate from the original agreement
          will be treated as new commissions and priced accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >In the case of a major project change or new request after
            delivery, clients may be asked to start a new commission and pay a
            separate charge.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        All personal information and project details shared by the client will
        remain confidential and will not be disclosed to third parties without
        explicit consent. This includes any reference materials, communication,
        and payment details.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to showcase non-confidential aspects of completed
        projects in portfolios, social media posts, or promotional materials
        unless otherwise requested by the client.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Communication Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All communication will be conducted via email, Discord, or the
          platform specified during the order. Clients are encouraged to respond
          promptly to minimize delays.
        </li>
        <li>
          The creator reserves the right to decline inappropriate or abusive
          communication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Clients should provide feedback and approval in a timely manner.
            Delays in communication may result in project delays.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Customer Responsibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clients are responsible for providing accurate and detailed
          descriptions, including reference images and preferred features.
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure to provide necessary resources in a timely manner may result
          in delays or additional charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          When purchasing a product, clients must provide confirmation of the
          base model in the form of a Unitypackage, Blendfile, or any other
          valid proof of ownership. If unable to do so, the order will be
          canceled, and a refund issued, or the client may pay an additional fee
          of <strong>€20 for sourcing the base model.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >It is the client’s responsibility to ensure that the base model and
            materials provided are free from third-party intellectual property
            claims.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>I'm not responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Technical issues with third-party platforms or applications where the
          avatar is used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Client dissatisfaction due to unclear or incomplete instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Loss of data or assets due to client errors or system
            failure.</strong
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Any disputes or claims arising from these terms shall be resolved
        through direct communication. If no resolution is reached, both parties
        may seek mediation or legal recourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >For the avoidance of doubt, this agreement is governed by the laws of
          the jurisdiction in which Mystic (the service provider) is
          based.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h2>12. Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        By placing an order, the client acknowledges that they have read,
        understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service. This agreement is
        binding and cannot be altered without the written consent of both
        parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms are subject to periodic updates. Clients will be notified of
        any significant changes prior to the new terms taking effect.
